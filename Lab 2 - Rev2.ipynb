The first will be classifying individuals into two separate classes based upon whether or not they earned less than or more than 50,000 dollars a year.  This is the classification task for which the data was gathered, and will help provide insight into which factors best predict an individual's income level.  \n",

This will provide insight into how well economic factors can predict an individuals marital status to answer questions such as \"do married people generally earn more?\" or \"does earning more increase the odds of being or becoming divorced?\".  These questions can be of great interest to social scientists and legislators who may want to put forward new policy to account for or attempt to influence any trends found by these classification tasks."

    "Organizations that may be interested in our model include economists, social scientists, and legislators.  Economists will be interested in seeing what factors contribute to an individual's general income level so that they can better understand modern economical factors that affect the population (in our case US workers).  Social scientists will be interested in seeing what factors contribute to a person's marital status so that they can better understand how the economic health of a family affects the health of the marriage.  Finally, legislators and other government officials will be interested in both of these effects so that they can draft legislation to support individual welfare for their citizens and the economic health of their country as a whole.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We would measure the model's value for these parties by how accurately it is able to predict both of its classifications.  This is because the more accurately it predicts the class of individuals in the model the more useful any action taken by the legislators and other interested parties can be expected to be.  For example, if the classification is only 20% predictive of an individuals economic or marital health, then an economist or social scientist lecturer will not be likely to include the model in their class materials.  However, if that classification is 95% accurate in predicting the class then not only will these scientists be wise to teach concepts based on the model results but that model can be used reliably in their future research.  Likewise, if a legislator drafts a new law based upon results of the model and the model is inaccurate then that law will be ineffective at combating the effects that they thought were real but were really just based on modeling error.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For economists and social scientists we would deploy this model by sharing both the results of our model and the code that produced those results, which will allow them to perform similar classification on other populations of interest to their studies and research.  For legislators we would instead show them only the results but not the code (which they would not be trained to understand) in order to provide a proof of concept.  After obtaining funding from those legislators we would then move forward with deploying this model against Census data for their country, which would not only help train the model to that country's specific situation but would provide historical insight into the situations the country's citizens have recently found themselves in.  Finally, we would prepare the code such that when new Census data was received one could quickly feed that data into the model and receive actionable insights tailored specifically to that country's situation.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The other data that would be collected for this model include historical Census data specific to the country for which we are applying the model (as the existing data is restricted to a population of US individuals), as well as future Census data that would be collected after the initial model had already been built.  In this situation the model would need to be updated every Census cycle as new data is collected, which for the US would be every 10 years.  If the customer for the model is an economist or social scientist that is unaffiliated with any government entity but is interested in doing their own research, then the additional data needed will be survey data from the population of interest for their research.  In this situation the model will need to be updated anytime new survey data is collected.  "
